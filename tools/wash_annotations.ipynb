    "# Methodology for Washing an Annotation Database\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the process used to clean and validate annotations in a database of captions for remote sensing images. The process ensures the quality and consistency of the annotations by applying specific rules and validations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases Involved\n",
    "\n",
    "Three databases are used in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`annotation.db`**: The original annotation database containing the captions.\n",
    "2. **`metadata.db`**: The original metadata database associated with the annotations.\n",
    "3. **`rejected_annotation.db`** (optional): A database to record annotations that fail the validation rules for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning process applies the following rules to validate the annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invalid Characters**:\n",
    "   - Only a defined set of characters is allowed: letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation (`.,!?;:'\"-%/()&#‘’“”`), and specific symbols.\n",
    "   - Any annotation containing characters outside this set is marked as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unbalanced Brackets**:\n",
    "   - Annotations must have balanced brackets, including `()`, `[]`, and `{}`.\n",
    "   - If brackets are unbalanced, the annotation is marked as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abnormal Length**:\n",
    "   - Annotations with fewer than 10 words or more than 120 words are marked as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Case for Separators**:\n",
    "   - The double dash (`—`) is considered a valid separator only if it appears in pairs (even count). Single or uneven occurrences of the dash are marked as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation involves Python code that validates each annotation based on the defined rules. Below is an explanation of the key components of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expression for Invalid Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PATTERN = r\"[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s.,!?;:'\\\"\\-%\\/()&#\\ʻ\\’\\“\\”]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular expression identifies any character not in the allowed set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function to Check Balanced Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find_unbalanced_brackets(text):\n",
    "    stack = {'(': 0, '[': 0, '{': 0}\n",
    "    for ch in text:\n",
    "        if ch in stack:\n",
    "            stack[ch] += 1\n",
    "        elif ch in ')]}':\n",
    "            if ch == ')' and stack['('] > 0:\n",
    "                stack['('] -= 1\n",
    "            elif ch == ']' and stack['['] > 0:\n",
    "                stack['['] -= 1\n",
    "            elif ch == '}' and stack['{'] > 0:\n",
    "                stack['{'] -= 1\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                return True\n",
    "    return not all(v == 0 for v in stack.values())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function ensures that brackets in the annotations are properly balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function to Validate Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def check_validity(pattern, text):\n",
    "    is_valid = False\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Identify invalid characters\n",
    "    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n",
    "    if bool(matches):\n",
    "        cnt = 0\n",
    "        for match in matches:\n",
    "            if match == '—':\n",
    "                cnt += 1\n",
    "        if cnt // 2 > 0 and cnt % 2 == 0:\n",
    "            is_valid = True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        is_valid = True\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check for unbalanced brackets\n",
    "    is_valid = is_valid and not find_unbalanced_brackets(text)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check for abnormal length\n",
    "    num_splits = len(text.split())\n",
    "    is_valid = is_valid and (10 <= num_splits <= 120)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return is_valid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function evaluates each annotation against the validation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation process is applied to the `annotation.db` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "anno_table['valid'] = anno_table['ANNOTATION'].apply(lambda x: check_validity(PATTERN, x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations marked as valid (`True`) are retained in the cleaned database, while those marked as invalid (`False`) can be optionally recorded in `rejected_annotation.db`."
